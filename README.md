# ⚒️ Forge

**Forge** is an **AI-powered project planning and collaboration platform for developers**. It helps teams move from idea to execution by intelligently analyzing team skills, project goals, and progress to generate tech stack recommendations, role assignments, and task breakdowns — all in one place.

Instead of manually deciding who does what and which tools to use, Forge acts as a smart project planner that evolves with your project.
